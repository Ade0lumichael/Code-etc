<p>It usually all starts with an inspiring story from childhood about some event that drastically changes the life of the author or something of the sort. 
Sorry to disappoint, there isn’t much of a backstory that inspired me to write this awesome book, in fact, if anything, I am just as ordinary or more ordinary than the person on the other side of this page wondering what I have to offer within the next few pages or if I’ll be able to hold your attention or if this is going to be the “Soon to be #1 New York best seller” written on the cover of the book or probably just wondering what to eat for dinner.
It’s just a book documenting the life of a 21-year old modern day nerd from Nigeria who has a weird mix of serious dreams like wanting restructure the future of education targeted at teaching the generations behind to make better decision than the ones before as well as wanting to become a renowned Chef, Speaker and Author and less awe-inspiring ones like wanting to be among the most attractive men worldwide by 2030 even though being super far from it.</p>
